###### Section 1
# There are differences in the way people think about data about themselves and multiple people

### People think about data ownership not rights
Through testing people talked about “my data” or “owning data” and this meant they can use it as they want. Ownership appears to be the best available language to people, when meaning their rights over data.

### People have an individualistic view of data rights
No one talked about having shared ownership or rights over data. Let along shared rights.

### People don’t understand how data can be misused 
This becomes even more important when the data they’re sharing is not just about themselves, but also about others. 

### People don’t understand anonymity 
People think that if data doesn’t include a name or date of birth, it’s anonymous. 

### People don’t have time and energy to understand rights and risks
People have lives to live. They are busy. As we heard time and again in research, people have limited time and energy to know the right and risks for every product and service they use.
