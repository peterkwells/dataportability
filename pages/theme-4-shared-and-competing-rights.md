# Shared and competing rights

Data portability needs new thinking and new techniques. Past initiatives like midata have not had the effects they intended. And it’s still unclear whether regulation designed to enable data portability, such as PSD2 and GDPR, will be successful. 

Data is often about multiple people. This needs to be taken into account to design services that enable data portability and are respectful of people’s rights. For example, data held by a social network that describes a friendship is about two people - almost by definition. 
Sometimes people feel comfortable with someone else porting data about them. In other situations, they may want to limit the types of data about them that can be ported, or the purpose of its use. Occasionally, different people's rights will compete and this will sometimes require independent or official mediation.

A new approach is needed to design services that enable data portability and at the same time respect the rights, choices and opinions of multiple people.

Two prototypes helped us explore these challenges. The first one looks at how data portability could work in the context of a social networking site - when data is inherently about multiple people. The second, Squid Telecom, allows you to download your household’s internet history.

## Prototype
### Withholding information from a social media archive

When leaving FriendShare, you can request an archive of all the content and interactions from your time using the service.

People who have data about them in the requested archive will receive a notification.

They are given 24 hours to choose what information about them can be included in the archive.

## Prototype 
### Understanding your house internet history

Squid allows you to download your home’s internet history. This helps you understand better your internet use, identify reasons for connection issues or see what data we store about you.

Internet history is sensitive information and can only be viewed with consent, from everyone. It’s our policy that every person registered to your address made, made agree before this information is made available to use.

In the event there isn’t agreement to view the house internet history, you can appear using the Data Rights Commission’s mediation service

## Summary of findings

### People want to be considered when someone else is porting data about them
This relies on people knowing that data about them is being ported, understanding their rights around data portability and having a clear way to exercise these rights. For example, people were very positive about the idea of being alerted to someone else porting data about them from a social network. 

### People can be described in data held by services they’ve never used
Data can be collected about people without them realising. From family shopping lists, photographs online or voices on smart speakers, data can describe people who have never consciously used a service. How does someone’s right to data portability work in a situation like this? And what is their ability to contest someone else's right to portability?

### People sometimes have competing individual rights
One person’s right to port data from one service to another, could compete with another person’s right to delete that same data. For example, if one person wanted to use the internet history data from their house but their housemate didn’t want anyone to see this information. Because multiple people are involved, one person’s right to data portability is in direct competition with another person’s right to privacy. 

### People won’t always agree about porting data
Depending on the situation, the people the data is about, and the sensitivity of the data, people won’t always agree to porting information.
