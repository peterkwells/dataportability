## Prototype
### Confirming data transfer after moving home

By using open APIs and common data standards, councils could provide a service that makes it easy to transfer information from one council to another.

This letter confirms data transfer has happened and shows that the old council has reduced the amount of information they store about previous residents.

Itâ€™s useful to prove you lived at an address, for example when applying for a mortgage, so the letter contains a code that can be used with an online service to prove residency in the future.
