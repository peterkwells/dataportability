###### Section 2
# The purpose for porting data and the organisations involved is key

Most of the commentary around data portability focuses on competition - and argues that portability will allow people to switch more easily between providers of the same, or similar, services.

However, there are different reasons why someone might choose to use data portability. For example, a person may choose to port data to a third party who provides them with a service that complements the data’s original use. They may also choose to port data to an organisation for an entirely different purpose, such as for research.

Another important factor in data portability is the type of organisations involved. This includes the organisation that currently holds the data and the intended recipient. The different levels of trust people have in the way organisations use data will affect how they engage with data portability.

## Prototype
### Confirming data transfer after moving home

By using open APIs and common data standards, councils could provide a service that makes it easy to transfer information from one council to another.

This letter confirms data transfer has happened and shows that the old council has reduced the amount of information they store about previous residents.

It’s useful to prove you lived at an address, for example when applying for a mortgage, so the letter contains a code that can be used with an online service to prove residency in the future.

## Summary of findings

### People need a clear purpose in order to use data portability
Without a clear reason for porting data, people are less likely to exercise their right to portability. This means the practical benefits of moving information from one service to another needs to be obvious - that could mean gaining new knowledge or just convenience. 

### People are more comfortable with data portability if the purpose is the same as the original use. 
We found people were most comfortable with the idea of using data portability to help them switch between similar services. For example, people could see clear benefits and felt comfortable with the idea of sharing energy use data to compare suppliers. People also understood the potential for misuse.

### People are interested in using data portability for different uses
We found people were excited by the prospect of data portability to services other than for switching. For example being able to understand your diet by accessing data from shopping lists. These services compliment other services, rather than being in competition with them. The portability of data about multiple people isn’t covered extensively in GDPR - guidance produced by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party suggests that data portability will be permitted only if “the data are used for the same  purpose” and “the rights and freedoms of [other individuals] will not be  respected” if the purpose if different.

### People will trust organisations differently to port data
For example, council tax data being transferred between local authorities with moving house, people were comfortable with. This stemmed from the use for portability being switching, but also people described how they couldn’t conceive why the council would misuse this information.
