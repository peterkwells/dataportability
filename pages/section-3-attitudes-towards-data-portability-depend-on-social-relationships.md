# Attitudes towards data portability depend on social relationships

People have complex relationships with other people and these relationships can shape the way that services are used.

In some cases, one person interacts with a service on behalf of a group of people. By default, that person makes decisions about how data about the group is used. For example, a lead tenant in a shared household may share information about other tenants with a utilities provider. Gaining their permission is likely to happen outside of the service itself, or may be implied by the nature of their relationship.

The ways that organisations respond to data portability - particularly when data is about multiple people - will need to address the social relationships that people have.

## Prototype
### Comparing energy providers for a better deal

EnergyMeter shows live information about how much energy is being used in a home.

[Illustration 1]

You can review and share detailed energy usage information, to find and switch to a cheaper provider.

[Illustration 2]

Behaviour can be inferred from energy consumption information. Before sharing this information with a price comparison service, a prompt is displayed to encourage the person switching to talk to others in the home.

[Illustration 3]

Once information is shared, you can review and switch directly from the screen.

### Deciding what the family watches

Content Player allows you to share your parental settings with other media services. This means your family’s choices about what it does and doesn’t watch, can more easily set and updated.

## Summary of findings

### People can have control by default over data about other people
The way most service are designed now, one person has control over data about multiple people. This could being the bill payer over energy data or account holder over what TV a house watches. Rarely do people realise their are in this position of power. 

### People often rely on a single person to make decisions on behalf of a group.
We heard repeatedly how people delegate control over data about them to someone they trust. Be that a parent, partner or grandchild. Rather than this happening by default, we heard how people use delegation to unburden those they live with. 

### People’s rights being respected can rely on trusted relationships
One participant describe how they trust their granddaughter with diet information about them. This is and other anecdotes we heard, show data protection in groups relies on trusting relationships within them, rather than the design of those services data is mored between. 

### People can think they have more rights than others to control how data is used.
The best example of this was one person telling us how them paying the house bills, entitled them to do whatever they wanted with energy consumption data about their whole family. This shows a inconsistent mental models about the digital rights people think they and others have.

### People discuss data sharing in groups differently
Group dynamics here are very important here. Some groups will discuss data sharing and one person will have “final say”. Some will be more democratic process and take a vote. Others will not want to burden each other with every with each permission to share data. It’s important for services to not to predict how exactly discussion will happen, but allow people the time, space and awareness to talk. 

### People’s relationships aren’t always reflected in the services they use
Services rarely now support the relationships between people. This is problematic, as we’ve heard, as much trust in services and protecting data about multiple people relies social relationship. This is not about capturing these relationships in data, but design services to enable behaviours to live and work in groups, like deciding to share data between services.
