# Social relationships affect portability

People have complex relationships with other people and these relationships can shape the way that services are used.

In some cases, one person interacts with a service on behalf of a group of people. By default, that person makes decisions about how data about the group is used. For example, a lead tenant in a shared household may share information about other tenants with a utilities provider. Gaining their permission is likely to happen outside of the service itself, or may be implied by the nature of their relationship.

The ways organisations respond to data portability - particularly when data is about multiple people - will need to be reflective of people’s social relationships.

To explore how social relationships affect data portability, we created two prototypes. The first one, EnergyMeter, collects information about energy use which can be shared with a price comparison tool to help you switch providers. The second prototype, media service Flixxer, makes it easier to set and update parental settings across different media services.

## Prototype
### Comparing energy providers for a better deal

EnergyMeter shows live information about how much energy is being used in a home.

[Illustration 1]

You can review and share detailed energy usage information, to find and switch to a cheaper provider.

[Illustration 2]

Behaviour can be inferred from energy consumption information. Before sharing this information with a price comparison service, a prompt is displayed to encourage the person switching to talk to others in the home.

Once information is shared, you can review and switch directly from the screen.

## Prototype 
### Deciding what the family watches

You can set what Flixxer shows your children watch.

You can shares these parental settings with other media services. This means your family’s choices about what it does and doesn’t watch, can more easily set and updated.

## Summary of findings

### People often have control over data about others
The way most services are designed now, one person has control over data about multiple people. For example, the bill payer might control data about a household’s energy consumption or the account holder might control information about which TV shows a house watches. Rarely do people realise that they are in control of data about other people and therefore in a position of power. 

### People often rely on one person to make decisions on behalf of a group
We repeatedly heard that people often delegate control over data about them to someone they trust. That might be a parent, partner or grandchild. This isn’t control by default like in the point above. Instead, people sometimes gave up control to make life easier - and unburdens them from making decisions. 

### People often rely on others they trust to respect their rights 
People rely on others they trust to look after information about them. For example, one person told us that they would trust their granddaughter with information about their diet. In examples like this, trusted relationships determine the movement of data between services - rather than the design of the services themselves.

### People sometimes think they are the only person with the right to control data
The most striking example of this was when one person told us that because they paid the energy bills, they could do what they wanted with energy consumption data about their whole family. There was a lot of variation in people’s understanding of their digital rights and the rights of others. 

### People take different approaches to discussing data sharing
We found that differences in group dynamics were important to the way people discuss data sharing. In some groups, one person has the “final say”. Some groups are more democratic and take a vote. And sometimes groups decide they don’t want to burden each other with every detail about sharing data. It’s important that services don’t make assumptions about how decisions about data are made in groups. Services need to allow people the time, space and awareness to talk. 

### People’s relationships often aren’t considered by the services
Services rarely consider relationships between people. This is problematic, as we’ve heard, as much trust in services and protecting data about multiple people relies social relationship. This is not about capturing these relationships in data, but designing services to enable behaviours of people who live and work in groups, like helping them decide to share data between services.
