###### Principles
# Designing for data portability

Updated by this work and building on recent work on [Open APIs in the Telecoms Industry](https://openapis.projectsbyif.com/), we started design principles for data portability. Some of these are specific to data about multiple people, we also used them more broadly to design services that empower people to exercise their right to data portability. 

### Enable more than one person to access data portability features
Shared services, like broadband and home utilities often only allow the bill payer to access information about the account. To let other people exercise their right to data portability, shared services should allow access to more than one person.

### Offer different ways of moving data between services
JSON and CSV files are common ways of enabling data portability, but some people may not how to use them. Services should also offer direct data transfer to another service, using secure protocols, well-documented open standards and APIs.

### . Allow people to choose what data is moved between services
Sometimes a service might allow transferring more data than is necessary for another service. People should have more control over how much data and what types of data are transferred.

### Minimise or delete data after a transfer
If data is no longer needed by the service it originally comes from, people should be able to delete it. Sometimes it’s useful to retain data. In this case, data should be minimised to the minimum amount necessary for a service to function.

### Make data portable at the point of use
Often data portability features are hidden deep within the settings of a service. Opportunities to use data portability should be brought out in context, in useful moments of a service.

### Help people understand their and others rights
Newer products like connected speakers, smart meters and wearables create new classes of data where there isn't a popular understanding of how this data can be used and misused.

### Allow people to find and separate data about them

Accounts are designed to give one person access to a service, but in reality, some people share accounts. For example, a couple might share an email account. Services should allow people to find and separate data about them and so they can port it to another service.

### Add a delay to data portability actions
This will allow everyone involved with a dataset to properly assess whether they want data to be transferred and gives them an opportunity to object. If the delay runs out and nobody has objected, the data transfer should happen.

### Provide a way of resolving disputes
Data about multiple people causes some conflicting rights under GDPR. Services should provide a mechanism for these rights to be mediated by a trusted third party. This will require new skills, training  and in some cases new institutions.

### Understand the relationships between people using a shared service
People's ability to exercise data portability rights depends on existing relationships. For example, in a family setting, it may not be necessary to have the same level of consent as in a flatshare setting. It’s also important consider what happens when relationships break down.

### Thinking beyond anonymity
People can be identity from data without their name, date of birth, address or other data will typically make us identifiable. 

[Shopping list example]

### Thinking beyond accounts
Even if people are logged in to an account as themselves, other people in their family or household may also use the account. What does this mean in terms of data being about multiple people?
