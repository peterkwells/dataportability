# What is data portability?

Data portability is the ability of people to share data about themselves held by organisations with third parties, including other organisations, services or people.

Some services enable users to do this already, such as when a new mobile app accesses photos or a calendar. In the past, initiatives like [midata](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-midata-vision-of-consumer-empowerment) have tried to make data portability happen by making it easier for individuals to access data about their accounts and activities to use it for new purposes. Customers of some energy suppliers can use the midata service to access data describing their energy consumption and upload it to third-party price comparison tools in order to find a better deal.

A new wave of regulation is increasing data portability. Financial regulation such as the European Union’s [revised Payment Services Directive](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-finalises-revised-psd2-requirements) (PSD2) and [Mexico’s FinTech law](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-finalises-revised-psd2-requirements) are fuelling the global ‘open banking’ trend. In doing so, growing numbers of customers of banks and other financial institutions can request that data about their accounts and transactions is transferred to a third party, such as an account aggregation tool. Open banking is expected to lead to increased competition between account providers, and support innovative new products and services for consumers.

Coming into force in May 2018, the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/) (GDPR) will strengthen people’s existing individual rights over data about them and introduce new ones, including the right to data portability. The right to data portability is a more extensive version of the existing right to data access. It gives people the right to get hold of data held about them by an organisation, but goes further in enabling them to obtain the data ‘for reuse across other services’.
