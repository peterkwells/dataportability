# Understanding data

Many of the products and services people use collect data. Services do this in different ways. For example, an e-commerce site will collect data directly when someone enters a billing address. It may also collect data indirectly when someone searches for a product. In turn, it might use these to generate new data about things people might buy.

This can be opaque to people. According to doteveryone’s recent study, over fifty percent of people can’t find out how much data they share when they use a service. 

If people are going to engage with digital rights such as portability, people will need to understand what data about them exists in the first place.

We developed two prototypes and tested them with people to explore their understanding of data:

* [Moving song preferences and voice recognition](#)
* [Knowledge about what everyone is eating](#)

## Prototype
### Moving song preferences and voice recognition

HausBox and Songs Box are smart speakers connected to the internet. Instructed using your voice, these devices to perform tasks, such as playing music or making shopping lists. 

HausBox recognises your voice and knows the songs your like. You want your new Songs Box speaker to do the same.

## Prototype
### Knowledge about what you eating

DietScan helps your see and understand more about the food you eat. 

By using codes on shopping receipts, Diet Scan instantly fetches nutritional information for every item of food you’ve bought.

To understand your diet, Diet Scan analysing items to calculate what you and others ate.

## Summary of findings

### People often aren’t aware of what data is held about them
When we showed people the prototypes and discussed other services that they used, we found that many didn’t know what types of data service hold about them. This is important because people need to understand what information a service holds about them in order to make an informed decision about porting data.

### People think about data ownership, not data rights
Throughout our testing, people talked about “my data” or “owning data.” People felt that because they ‘owned’ data about them, they could use it how they wanted. Ownership seems to be the best available language to people, when actually they were talking about their multiple rights over data about them.

### People understand data to be just about them
While many people described having ownership over data, very few people talked about shared ownership or multiple rights over data. Few people we tested with seemed to understand that data they control could also be about other people. This is a result of people’s individualistic view of data and the way services are currently designed. Without being prompted, people weren’t aware of sharing rights to portability. 

### People don’t understand how much data can say about them
Most people felt data was private if it didn’t include names, dates of birth and addresses. We found that people felt the risks of sharing some types of data, like energy use data, was very small. This is because people don’t understand how much can be inferred about them from this kind of data. 

### People often don’t understand how data can be misused
This becomes even more important when people are given the right to data portability and when the data they’re sharing is not just about themselves, but also about others. 

### People don’t have time to understand rights and risks
People have lives to live. They are busy. We frequently heard in our research that people have limited time and energy to understand their digital rights and the risks involved in every service they use.
