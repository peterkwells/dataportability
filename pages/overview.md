<h2 class="cover-style-subtitle">Exploring rights to data portability when the data describes more than one person</h2>

<h3 class="cover-style-date">May 2018</h3>

In collaboration with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/), IF researched how data portability could work when data is about multiple people. For example energy bills tell reveal who we live with.

We created seven scenarios to explore data portability. We developed prototypes and tested them with people who live in multigenerational houses in the UK. We used the prototypes to illustrate what data portability could look like in reality and provoke conversation, rather than to provide definitive solutions or services.

The aim of our work was to learn:

- Do people understand that data can be about multiple people?
- Do people understand that data about them can be used by multiple services?
- How do people feel about other people using data about them in other services?
- Can people recognise data about them amongst other peopleâ€™s information?
- What are the challenges of moving data about multiple people?

This report contains our research findings and the prototypes we used. It also includes recommendations to help organisations design for data portability in ways that respect the rights, opinions and choices of multiple people.
