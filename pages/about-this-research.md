# About this research

We began this work by identifying scenarios where multiple data about multiple people is involved.

From these scenarios, we created seven prototypes that show data portability in a way we hoped people would recognise from everyday life.

These prototypes were presented to five people in hour-long research sessions. The prototypes provoked conversations to help us answer the following research questions:

- Do people understand that data can be about multiple people?
- What are the challenges of transferring data about multiple people between services?
- How do people feel about other people using data about them in services?
- Do people realise other people might have rights to data about them?

The people we interviewed came from multi-generational households, across a range of genders and backgrounds. They had experience of using devices including laptops, smartphones, smart speakers and wearables and digital services including social media, streaming services and online shopping.
