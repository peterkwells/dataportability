# About this research

We began the work by listing scenarios where multiple people's data is involved.

Something about reading the GDPR legislation?

From these scenarios, we created seven prototypes that implement data portability in useful ways, in contexts that people recognise from everyday life.

These prototypes were presented to five people in hour-long research sessions. They facilitated conversations to help us answer these research questions:

- Do people understand that data about them can be used by multiple services?
- How do people feel about other people using data about them in other services?
- Can people recognise information about them amongst other people’s information?
- What are the limits of using information about multiple people?

The people we interviewed came from multi-generational households, across a range of genders and ethnic backgrounds. They used products including laptops, smartphones, smart speakers and wearables and digital services including social media, streaming services and online shopping.
