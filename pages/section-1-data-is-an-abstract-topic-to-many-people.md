###### Section 1
# Data is an abstract topic to many people

The services we use collect data about us. Sometimes we enter this data ourselves, like when we sign up for something and provide contact details. Data about us is also generated through our use of services, such as the logs that are created from searches we make on the web. Data can also be guessed, inferred or derived about us - retailers build profiles about people or categorise them based on what they buy.

People often aren’t aware of the type of data organisations hold about them. According to [a recent study](http://attitudes.doteveryone.org.uk/), over fifty percent of people can’t find out how much data they share when they use a service. People need a level of awareness about data to be able to engage with rights that give them more control over how it is collected, used and shared. This includes the right to data portability.

We developed two prototypes to help us explore this issue. The first prototype looked at the ability to move song preferences from one smart speaker to another, using voice recognition. The second prototype was an app called Diet Scan, which analyses shopping receipts to help you understand your diet, and the diets of other people you do the shopping for.

## Prototype
### knowledge about what you eating

DietScan helps your see and understand more about the food you eat. 

By using codes on shopping receipts, Diet Scan instantly fetches nutritional information for every item of food you’ve bought.

To understand your diet, Diet Scan analysing items to calculate what you and others ate.

## Prototype
### Moving song preferences and voice recognition

HausBox and Songs Box are smart speakers connected to the internet. Instructed using your voice, these devices to perform tasks, such as playing music or making shopping lists. 

HausBox recognises your voice and knows the songs your like. You want your new Songs Box speaker to do the same.

## Summary of findings

### People often aren’t aware of what data is held about them
When we showed people the prototypes and discussed other services that they used, we found that many didn’t know what types of data service hold about them. This is important because people need to understand what information a service holds about them in order to make an informed decision about porting data.

### People think about data ownership, not data rights
Throughout our testing, people talked about “my data” or “owning data.” People felt that because they ‘owned’ data about them, they could use it how they wanted. Ownership seems to be the best available language to people, when actually they were talking about their multiple rights over data about them.

### People understand data to be just about them
While many people described having ownership over data, very few people talked about shared ownership or multiple rights over data. Few people we tested with seemed to understand that data they control could also be about other people. This is a result of people’s individualistic view of data and the way services are currently designed. Without being prompted, people weren’t aware of sharing rights to portability. 

### People don’t understand how much data can say about them
Most people felt data was private if it didn’t include names, dates of birth and addresses. We found that people felt the risks of sharing some types of data, like energy use data, was very small. This is because people don’t understand how much can be inferred about them from this kind of data. 

### People often don’t understand how data can be misused
This becomes even more important when people are given the right to data portability and when the data they’re sharing is not just about themselves, but also about others. 

### People don’t have time to understand rights and risks
People have lives to live. They are busy. We frequently heard in our research that people have limited time and energy to understand their digital rights and the risks involved in every service they use.
