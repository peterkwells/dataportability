# Data is often about more than one person

Data can also be created by multiple people. A medical record might describe a person, their partner and other family members, as well as their doctor. A phone bill describes your friends, family, colleagues and when you speak to them.

In this report we do not refer to ‘people’s data’ but instead use terms like ‘data about them’. By avoiding possessive pronouns, we hope to encourage understanding of the wider network of relationships involved in data collection and use. 

When data is about multiple people, data portability becomes complicated. The choices people make about how data about them is used and shared can have an impact on other people also described by the data. Terms like ‘[interdependent privacy](https://fc13.ifca.ai/proc/10-1.pdf)’ help describe how the choices made by others can also have an impact on your own level of privacy.

The GDPR states that the right to portability “shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.” But the portability of data about multiple people isn’t covered extensively in the regulation. [Guidance](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44099) produced by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party suggests that organisations should not take an “overly restrictive interpretation." The guidance also states that users will have the right to portability over telephone and instant messaging records that include data about multiple people.
