In collaboration with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org), IF researched how data portability works when data is about multiple people.

We prototyped eight scenarios that explore the sharing and use of data about multiple people. We tested these with UK participants. The prototypes were used to provoke conversation and illustrate what data portability might look like in reality, rather than to provide definitive solutions or services.

The aim of our work was to learn: 

1. Do people understand that data can be about multiple people?
2. Do people understand that data about them can be used by multiple services?
3. How do people feel about other people using data about them in other services?
4. Can people recognise data about them amongst other peopleâ€™s information?
5. What are the limits of using information about multiple people?

This report contains the findings from our research and final versions of the prototypes we used. It also includes recommendations for organisations focused on designing for data portability in ways that respect the rights, opinions and choices of multiple people.
