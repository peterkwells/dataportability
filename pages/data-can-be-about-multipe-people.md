# Data can be about multipe people

Data is often about multiple people. Data can also be created by multiple people. A medical record might describe a person, their partner and other family members, as well as their doctor.

In this report we do not refer to ‘people’s data’ but instead use terms like ‘data about them’. By avoiding possessive pronouns we hope to encourage understanding of the wider network of relationships involved in data collection and use.

When data is about multiple people, data portability becomes complicated. The choices people make about how data about them is used and shared can impact other people also described by the data. Terms like ‘[interdependent privacy](https://fc13.ifca.ai/proc/10-1.pdf)’ describe how the choices made by others, in part, determine your own level of privacy.

The GDPR says that the right to portability “shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others”, but the portability of data about multiple people isn’t covered extensively in the regulation. [Guidance](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44099) produced by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party has suggested that organisations should not take an “overly restrictive interpretation" and that users will have the right to portability over telephone and instant messaging records that include data about multiple people.

The portability of data about multiple people is about more than regulation. Building understanding of how services can consider the rights, opinions and choices of multiple people in the context of data portability is important in building trust in data.
