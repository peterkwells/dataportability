# Data is still an abstract topic to many people

The services we use collect data about us. Sometimes we enter this data ourselves, like when we sign up for something and provide contact details. Data about us is also generated through our use of services, such as the logs that are created from searches we make on the web. Data can also be inferred or derived about us - retailers build profiles about people or categorise them based on what they buy.

People often aren’t aware of the type of data organisations hold about them. According to [a recent study](http://attitudes.doteveryone.org.uk/), over fifty percent of people can’t find out how much data they share when they use a service. People need a level of awareness about data to be able to engage with rights that give them more control over how it is collected, used and shared. This includes the right to data portability.

We developed two prototypes to help us explore this issue. The first prototype looked at the ability to move song preferences from one smart speaker to another, using voice recognition. The second prototype was an app called Diet Scan, which analyses shopping receipts to help you understand your diet, and the diets of other people you do the shopping for. You can see the full prototypes below.

## Prototype
### Moving song preferences and voice recognition

HausBox and Songs Box are smart speakers connected to the internet. Instructed using your voice, these devices to perform tasks, such as playing music or making shopping lists. 

HausBox recognises your voice and knows the songs your like. You want your new Songs Box speaker to do the same.

## Prototype
### knowledge about what you eating

Diet Scan helps your see and understand more about the food you eat. 

By using codes on shopping receipts, Diet Scan instantly fetches nutritional information for every item of food you’ve bought.

## Summary of findings

### People aren’t always aware of what data is held about them by services.
When we showed people the prototypes and discussed other services that they used, we found that many didn’t know what types of data service hold about them. This is important because people need to understand what information a service holds about them in order to make an informed decision about porting data.

### People generally think about data ownership, not rights.
Throughout our testing, people talked about “my data” or “owning data.” People felt that because they ‘owned’ data about them, they could use it how they wanted. Ownership seems to be the best available language to people, when actually they were talking about their multiple rights over data about them.

### People have an individualistic view of data.
While many people described having ownership over data, very few people talked about shared ownership or multiple rights over data. This individualistic view of data is reinforced by the fact that most digital services are designed for a one-to-one relationship with a single person. In reality, one account might be used by multiple people and therefore collect data about multiple people.

### People don’t understand that data is often about multiple people.
Few people we tested with seemed to understand that data they control could also be about other people. This is a result of people’s individualistic view of data and the way services are currently designed. Without being prompted, people weren’t aware of sharing rights to portability. 

### People don’t understand anonymity.
An absence of names, dates of birth and addresses was enough for most people to feel data wasn’t private. We found that people felt the risks of sharing some types of data, like energy use data, was very small. 

### People don’t always understand how data can be misused.
This becomes even more important [when people are given the right to data portability] and when the data they’re sharing is not just about themselves, but also about others. 

### People don’t have time and energy to understand rights and risks.
People have lives to live. They are busy. As we heard time and again in our research, people have limited time and energy to know the right and risks for every product and service they use. [and have little ability to every time they buy new product and use a new services to under --- limited ability to know what rights they have and the risk of]
