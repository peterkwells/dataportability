## Data portability means respecting multiple people’s rights
Data portability will enable people to more easily switch between providers of the same, or similar, services and enable entire new ones. Data is often about multiple people and the relationships they have with each other: families, housemates, partners, colleagues, friends, classmates. This means that when one person exercises their right to data portability, others may have rights to consent, deletion or restrict processing over the very same data. We believe that data portability should happen in ways that respect the rights of multiple people. 

A foundation for good data portability is services recognising that  multiple individuals may have rights to the same data. This will mean thinking beyond accounts. As shown in the smart speaker prototype, logins don’t always reflect the messier reality of who uses a device or service and therefore who has rights to port the data they store. 

We believe that respecting the rights of multiple people will be central to how services will need to work. As we’ve seen from previous work into the telecoms industry, recognising group rights to data portability could lead to whole new service types. **We recommend that policy-makers consider regulation for group rights** to encourage organisations to recognise shared rights in their services. 

## Services designed to support people’s relationships
In order to design for individual’s rights over data, services should better reflect the relationships people have with each other. This is less about perfectly modelling these relationships in data and software, but enabling people to use services in ways that respect their interactions as groups. In the context of data portability, approaches to do this include supporting people to:

- Delegate decisions to someone they trust
- Discuss decisions as a group before making them 
- Come to a consensus or majority agreement
- Notify someone data about them is going to used
- Give others time to consider the benefits and risks of doing something

For organisations who want to get started with this, **we recommend applying and testing the data portability design principles** we’ve created through this work.

**Developing new patterns for social consent will also be key to enabling data portability that respects everyone’s rights**. While there are legal examples like power of attorney for delegating responsibility, very few services support the relationships and rights that allow for data to be ported. There is space for brave organisations to lead the development of these social consent patterns and begin to develop industry standards for data portability and safeguarding group rights. 

## Some challenges cannot be engineered or automated
The fact that data is often about multiple people presents challenges to the ways that data is collected, used and shared. This includes when designing for data portability. In some cases, people might disagree about whether data should be ported; their rights might conflict. As the internet history prototype shows, there will be times when organisations may need to intervene and provide a mechanism for these rights to be mediated. Sometimes this mediation will need to be facilitated by a trusted third party. 

There is great opportunity to **pioneer the skills, training and institutional powers needed to mediate** when individual’s different digital rights, like data portability cannot be exercised with infringing others rights. The UK with it’s strong legal systems and civic technology scene is in a excellent position to lead this development for other countries to follow. This is an imperative as our lives and relationship are increasingly represented in the digital world we find ourselves in.
