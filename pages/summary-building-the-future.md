## Data portability needs to respect multiple people’s rights

Data portability will enable people to more easily switch between providers of the same, or similar, services and enable entire new ones. Data is often about multiple people and the relationships they have with each other: families, housemates, partners, colleagues, friends, classmates. This means that when one person exercises their right to data portability, others may have rights to consent, deletion or restrict processing over the very same data. We believe that data portability should happen in ways that respect the rights of multiple people. 

To build a good foundation for data portability, services need to recognise that multiple individuals may have rights to the same data. This will mean thinking beyond accounts. As shown in the smart speaker prototype, accounts often don’t reflect the messy reality of who actually uses a device or service, and therefore, who has rights to port any data stored.

We believe that new approaches are needed to build services that respect the rights of multiple people. As we’ve seen from previous work about telecoms, recognising group rights to data portability could lead to whole new types of services. **We recommend that policy-makers consider regulation for group rights** to encourage organisations to recognise shared rights in their services. 

## Services need to consider people’s relationships 

In order to design for individual rights over data, services should better reflect the relationships people have with each other. This doesn't mean perfectly modelling relationships in data and software but enabling people to use services in ways that respect their interactions as groups. In the context of data portability, approaches to do this include supporting people to:

Delegate decisions to someone they trust
Discuss decisions as a group before making them 
Come to a consensus or majority agreement
Notify someone when data about them is going to used
Give others time to consider the benefits and risks of doing something

For organisations who want to get started with this, **we recommend applying and testing the data portability design principles** we’ve created through this work.

Developing new patterns for social consent will also be crucial to enabling data portability in a way that respects everyone’s rights. While there are legal examples for delegating responsibility, like power of attorney, very few digital services support us to do things on behalf of others. There is space for brave organisations to lead the development of social consent patterns and forge industry standards for data portability that safeguards group rights. 

## Data portability will sometimes need human intervention 

The fact that data is often about multiple people raises challenges around how data is collected, used and shared. This includes when designing for data portability. In some cases, people might disagree about whether data should be ported; their rights might conflict. As the internet history prototype shows, there will be times when organisations may need to intervene with a mechanism to mediate competing rights Sometimes, mediation will need to be facilitated by a trusted third party. 

There is great opportunity to **pioneer the skills, training and institutional powers needed to mediate** in situations when one person’s digital rights, like data portability, cannot be exercised without infringing another person's rights. The UK’s strong legal system and lively civic technology scene put it in an excellent position to lead the way. This is important because our lives and relationships are increasingly represented in the digital world.
