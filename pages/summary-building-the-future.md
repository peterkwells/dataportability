## Data portability that respects each person's rights
Data portability will enable people to switch services and invent entire new ones. We believe this should happen in ways that respects everyone rights. This is because data is increasingly about multiple people and the relationships they have with each other. Family, housemates, partners, colleagues, friends, classmates. Meaning when one person exercises their right to data portability, others may have rights to consent or deletion over the very same information. 

A foundation of this is services recognising the shared and sometimes competing rights of different individuals. This will mean thinking beyond accounts. As shown in the smart speaker prototype, logins don’t always reflect the messier reality of who uses a device or service and therefore who has rights to port the data they generate. Allow people to recognise people 

## Services designed to support people’s relationships
A approach services should take to ensure individuals rights are respected equally, is to support the relationships people with each other. This is less about perfectly modelling these relationships in data and software, but services enabling the ways people already use to live and work in groups. Delegating decisions to someone we trust. Discussing decisions before making them. Coming to a consensus or majority agreement. Notifying someone data about them is going to used. Giving others time to consider the benefits and risks of sharing data. 

While, there are examples like Power of attorney for delegating responsibility, very few digital services support the relationships and rights we towards one another. One is the Dutch government's student loan service. 


## Challenges that cannot be engineered or automated
Data about multiple people causes some conflicting rights under GDPR. Services should provide a mechanism for these rights to be mediated by a trusted third party. This will require new skills, training  and in some cases new institutions.
