###### Section 2
# Data uses, organisations and trust

Most of the commentary around data portability focuses on competition - and argues that portability will allow people to switch more easily between providers of the same, or similar, services.

However, there are different reasons why someone might choose to use data portability. For example, a person may choose to port data to a third party who provides them with a service that complements the data’s original use. They may also choose to port data to an organisation for an entirely different purpose, such as for research. 

We found that people were interested in the possibility of moving data to a new service with a different purpose. However, guidance produced by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party on GDPR suggests that the  portability of data which is about multiple people will be permitted only if “the data are used for the same purpose.” The body argues that “the rights and freedoms of [other individuals] will not be respected” if the purpose is different. 

Another important factor in data portability is the type of organisations involved. This includes the organisation that currently holds the data and the intended recipient. The different levels of trust people have in the way organisations use data will affect how they engage with data portability.

To explore this issue, we created a prototype of a fictional council service that makes it easy to transfer information from one council to another.

## Prototype
### Confirming data transfer after moving home

By using open APIs and common data standards, councils could provide a service that makes it easy to transfer information from one council to another.

This letter confirms data transfer has happened and shows that the old council has reduced the amount of information they store about previous residents.

It’s useful to prove you lived at an address, for example when applying for a mortgage, so the letter contains a code that can be used with an online service to prove residency in the future.

## Summary of findings

### People need a clear reason to reuse data
Without a clear reason for porting data, people are less likely to exercise their right to portability. This means the practical benefits of moving information from one service to another need to be obvious. For example, this could be the convenience of easily moving council tax details from one local authority to local authority.

### People are most comfortable with porting data between similar services 
We found people were most comfortable with the idea of using data portability to help them switch between similar services. For example, people could see clear benefits and felt comfortable with the idea of sharing energy use data to compare suppliers. People also understood the potential for misuse.

### People are interested in reuse of data in different types of services
We found people were excited by the prospect of using data portability to move data to entirely new service types - rather than just switching between similar services. For example, being able to understand their diet by giving an app access to data on their shopping list. Services like the diet app compliment the original service, rather than being in direct competition.

### People will trust organisations differently 
For example, people were comfortable with the idea of council tax data being transferred between local authorities. This is partly because it was a direct switch between similar services. But people also said that they couldn’t see why or how the council would misuse this information.
