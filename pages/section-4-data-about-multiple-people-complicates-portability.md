# Data about multiple people complicates portability

Data portability is hard. Past initiatives like midata have not had the effects they intended. It’s still unclear whether regulation designed to enable data portability, such as PSD2 and GDPR, will be successful.  Data about multiple people complicates data portability further.

Sometimes people will feel comfortable with someone else porting data about them. In other scenarios, they may want to limit the types of data about them that can be ported, or the purpose of its use. Occasionally, multiple people’s rights will become tangled and they will need to be mediated.

Data portability is particularly challenging when data is inherently about more than one person. For example, data held by a social network that describes a friendship is about two people almost by definition. In the context of data portability, designing services that respect the rights, as well as the choices and opinions, of multiple people will be difficult.

## Prototype
### Withholding information from a social media archive

When leaving FriendShare, you can request an archive of all the content and interactions from your time using the service.

[Illustration 1]

People who have data about them in the requested archive will receive a notification.

[Illustration 2]

They are given 24 hours to choose what information about them can be included in the archive.

## Prototype 
### Understanding your house internet history

Squid allows you to download your home’s internet history. This helps you understand better your internet use, identify reasons for connection issues or see what data we store about you. 

[illustration 1]

Internet history is sensitive information and can only be viewed with consent, from everyone. It’s our policy that every person registered to your address made, made agree before this information is made available to use.

In the event there isn’t agreement to view the house internet history, you can appear using the Data Rights Commission’s mediation service

## Summary of findings

### People want their rights, choices and opinions to be considered when someone else is porting data about them.
For example, people responded strongly to being alerted to someone else porting data about them from a social network. This need of people relies on people being aware data being ported, what rights their have and a clear way to exercise them. 

### People’s rights for data in services they don’t use
Data about people can be collected without them or even a service alway recognising. From family shopping lists, photographs online or voices on smart speakers, data describes people who have never consciously used a service. What are these people’s right to data portability? Or to contest another’s rights to this? 

### People can sometimes have competing individual rights.
One person’s right to port data from one service to another, could be competing with another person’s right for the same data being deleted. For example one person wants to use the internet history data from their house, while their housemate’s don’t want anyone seeing this information. Given multiple are involved, one person’s right to data portability is competing with another’s right to privacy. 

### People won’t always agree with each other to port data
Depending on the situation, the people the data is about and the sensitivity of that data, they won’t always agree to porting information. The way these situations are resolved needs to be fair, open and understandable.
